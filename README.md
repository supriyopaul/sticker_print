# Sticker Sheet Creator — Outline edition

GitHub fork: [supriyopaul/sticker_print](https://github.com/supriyopaul/sticker_print), based on [vaclavdekanovsky/sticker_print](https://github.com/vaclavdekanovsky/sticker_print). The outline changes are on branch `feature/object-outlines`; `master` remains the original upstream version.

## Colored object outlines

Upload an image and click its edit button or its sheet preview. **Object outline** is beside **Background**, **Zoom**, and **Rotate**:

- Enable the outline and choose its color and thickness (0.25–5% of the image's shorter side). Thickness scales with zoom.
- **Auto** uses existing transparency, or detects a dominant solid color around the image's edges. **Transparency only** and **Solid background** let you choose explicitly.
- **Tolerance** controls how close pixels must be to the detected background color. Only connected background pixels reaching an image edge are removed; enclosed same-color object details are retained.
- Choose whether to replace the detected background with the selected sticker background or keep the original background behind the outline.
- Changes preview live. **Save Changes** applies the same image processing to the sheet and PDF. ZIP version 2 includes both original and processed images plus outline/crop settings, so imported stickers remain editable without double outlines.

Processing runs locally in your browser: no image uploads, AI models, or external services. It is intended for transparent artwork and simple, nearly uniform backgrounds, **not subject segmentation in complex photographs**. If no clear boundary is found, the editor warns and keeps the original image. Objects touching the image or crop boundary may have clipped outlines. Large-image mask detection is limited to 2048 pixels on the longest side; original artwork resolution is retained. Outline rendering accepts up to 16 megapixels and 8192 pixels per side, and asks you to resize larger sources.

Run the fork with `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5174`. Pure mask tests: `npm test`. Browser regressions: `npm run test:e2e` (install Playwright Chromium first with `npx playwright install chromium`). Set the `STICKER_PORT` environment variable to test another port. Production build: `npm run build`.

## Original application

A web application for creating, organizing, and printing custom sticker sheets (A4 size). Designed for easy personalization of Christmas stickers, but versatile enough for any sticker needs.

## Features

-   **Flexible Paper Layout**: 
    -   Choose from standard presets (e.g., 2x4, 3x6).
    -   **Custom Grid**: Create any layout (e.g., "5x5 Custom") by simply adjusting rows/columns.
    -   **Orientation**: Visual buttons to easily switch between Portrait and Landscape modes.
-   **Multipage Support**: Automatically handles overflow by generating multiple pages in both the preview and PDF export.
-   **Advanced Editing**:
    -   **Crop & Zoom**: Focus on the best part of your image.
    -   **Fit Modes**: Choose between **Fill** (crop to fill the slot) or **Whole** (fit entire image without cropping).
    -   **Sticker Sizes**: Support for **1 Slot** (Standard) or **2 Slots** (Wide/Full Width) stickers.
    -   **Rotate & Flip**: Fine-tune orientation with 90° rotation buttons and flip controls.

-   **Smart ZIP Export/Import**: 
    -   Exports all processed images along with a `metadata.json` file.
    -   **Restores Everything**: When you import the ZIP back, it remembers your sticker quantity, size, edit settings, and order.
    -   Also supports importing standard ZIPs containing just images.
